                                totally different
                                online debating applications - one the largest public repository of online debates
                                called Debate.org and
                                the other a conceptual prototype based on research within AI argumentation developed by
                                myself at
                                King's College London for my summer MSc Advanced Computer Science thesis. Ultimately the
                                user study should be fun and interesting and you are successfully contributing towards
                                critical research on the development of future web applications!</p>

                            <p>The user study is (hopefully) super simple and should only take 45 minutes to an hour at
                                most. Read all
                                the three sets of bullet-point instructions and
                                follow them in order - ultimately a laptop or desktop computer is suitable to best
                                experience both platforms, however if you choose to use a mobile or tablet, that is
                                totally fine too!</p>
                            <code>Without further ado, turning to the bullet point instructions for Debate.org:</code>
                            <p></p>
                            <li>First, use the navbar link to navigate to the worlds largest online debate platform
                                called
                                Debate.org.</li>
                            <li>Spend some time on Debate.org familiarising yourself with the website and platform.</li>
                            <li>Secondly, try to spend some time interacting with Debate.org.</li>
                            <li>Interaction can mean reading some active debates, creating a Debate.org account and
                                contributing to live debates, starting new debates, contributing to forums and polls.
                            </li>
                            <li>Debate.org is open source and does not require an account - you can easily contribute
                                anonymously.</li>
                            <li>If you are already an expereinced member of Debate.org that is totally fine and you can
                                proceed to testing the Argupedia application.</li>
                            <li>Finally, after 20 to 45 minutes spent on Debate.org click on the Attrakdif
                                survey link in the
                                Navbar and navigate to filling out a survey on your experience and opinions of the
                                Debate.org platform.</li>

                            <li>Use the navbar to reach the Attrakdif survey links.</li>
                            <li>Click on the correct link for either the Debate.org or the Argupedia multiple choice
                                survey.</li>
                            <li>An Attrakdif survey should take roughly 3 to 5 minutes to complete.</li>
                            <li>The Attrakdif survey uses word pairs in which you rate the platform between two starkly
                                contrasted words.</li>
                            <li>Do not ponder over the word pairs and make your assessment spontaneously - you may feel
                                that some word pairs do not fit the product very well.</li>
                            <li>However, I would ask you to give an answer anyway. Remember at all times that there are
                                no "right" or "wrong" answers - your personal opinion is what counts.</li>

                            <li>Firstly, please watch the following YouTube video will hopefully make the intearction
                                with the Argupedia platform totally clear.</li>
                            <li>Secondly, don't forget to use the navbar links to fill out the Attrakdif survey for
                                Argupedia - it will be the exact same survey again!</li>
